### A Game made to be hacked ###
PyHack is a pygame game that has the client and server source code shared and you run it without compiling. There will be 4 levels of anticheat you can have for the server.
0. No anticheat at all and very easy to hack in items and do anything you want as the server does not check packets to see if they are legit
1. Basic Anticheat, player cannot hack in items but will have ability for basic movement hacks and combat hacks
2. Mid Anticheat, player cannot perform movement hacks but will have ability for combat hacks
3. Max Anticheat, player will be restricted to pure vanilla functions
Remember that all this anticheat will be coded to my best ability so if you have any patches pull request and I will check it and implement it.(Not super experienced with using github and pull requests so sorry in advance if there are problems)
